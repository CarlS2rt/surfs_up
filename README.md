# Oahu Temperature Trends

## Project Overview:

The purpose of this project is to analyze the temperature trends for Oahu to determine if it is a good spot to open a surf shop. The project performs statistical analysis on different months of the year to compare and contrast weather patterns to help make a decision for opening the surf shop.

## Results:

- The lowest temperature for December is 56 degrees, and the lowest temperature for June is 64 degrees.  There is an 8 degree difference for lowest temperature between the two months. 
- The mean temperature for December is 71 degrees, and the mean temperature for June is 75 degrees. The average temperature in June and December is above 70 degrees. 
- The IQR for June temperatures is 4 degrees, and the IQR for December temperatures is 5 degrees. Thus the temperatures for both December and June are statistically similar, and 50% of the data for each month falls within a 4 to 5 degree range.

## Summary:

Based on the data presented above, there is very little statistical deviation between temperatures in June and temperatures in December. Since these months represent opposite ends of the seasonal spectrum, it can be deduced that the temperatures in Oahu are very consistent throughout the year and conducive to supporting the investment in a surf shop on the island. 

To further support this conclusion, you can analyze the precipitation data for Oahu in both June and December. The descriptive statistics of each month are presented below:

June:

December:

The average rainfall in both June and December is less than 1/20th of an inch for a single day, and the IQR for both months is less than 3/20ths of an inch. Accordingly, Oahu also receives very little rain on average. With both ideal temperatures and precipitation, it can then be concluded that Oahu is an ideal spot for a surf shop and presents very low investment risk.
